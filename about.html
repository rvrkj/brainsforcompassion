            <p class="bforc-pink" style="line-height: 25px">We, as human beings, have the option to select and choose what we like to be and where we see ourselves in future. I have gone through this phase in my life and I am very proud to say that I choose to work for the communities around us which fulfil my soul to the best. Since childhood, I have gained aspirations and have been inspired by the people around me. I always wanted to support women and girls so that they can have their own voice and be heard. The social dilemma in which we are living is biased for women in so many ways regardless of how much progress we are making. Through Brains for Compassion, wings of hope will be nurtured so that we all can fly with our dreams and desires. <p  class="bforc-pink" style="line-height: 25px"> Brains for Compassion (BforC) came into existence with the same inspiration and motivation. Women have the power to transform the society and the only thing needed is to support and embrace their knowledge and wisdom. We, with BforC, came with an idea to start an all women organisation where women from different parts of the world can come together and help each other to grow in whatever possible manner they can.
            </p> <p  class="bforc-pink"> Let's be part of this journey and bring out the best among all! </p>
