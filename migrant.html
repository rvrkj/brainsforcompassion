            <h4>A LIFE SAVED</h4>
    <p>Several years ago, our 2014 Youth Award Honoree <a href="https://worldofchildren.org/honoree/jaylen-arnold/">Jaylen Arnold</a> was giving a presentation on the effects of bullying at a middle school in Florida. After the presentation, a girl named Rose approached him and confided in him that she was planning to commit suicide that night. She even showed Jaylen the marks on her arms where she had been cutting.</p>
    <p>Because of Jaylen’s presentation through his nonprofit organization, Jaylen’s Challenge, he was able to connect and intervene. Rose told him that she didn’t want to die anymore, and with resources Jaylen was able to pull together, they saved her life.</p>
